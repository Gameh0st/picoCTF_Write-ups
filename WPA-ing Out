NAME:

WPA-ing Out



DIFFICULTY:

medium



DESCRIPTION:

I thought that my password was super-secret, but it turns out that passwords passed over the AIR can be CRACKED, especially if I used the same wireless network password as one in the rockyou.txt credential dump.
Use this "https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/41/wpa-ing_out.pcap" and the rockyou wordlist. The flag should be entered in the picoCTF{XXXXXX} format.



WRITE-UP:

So first of all,we have a ".pcap" file ( "https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/41/wpa-ing_out.pcap" ) and a wordlist ("rockyou wordlist").
As you can see we need to crack the ".pcap" file to find the password (flag) and as you also know AIRCRACK can crack ".cap" and ".pcap" files.
So I started a virtual Kali-Linux via VirtualBox to be able to use AIRCRACK.
Afterwards I tried the passwords in "rockyou.txt" on the ".pcap" file with this code:
"sudo aircrack-ng <PATH OF THE .pcap FILE> -w <PATH OF THE WORDLISt>"
Afterwards we can see that the ".pcap" file has been cracked succesfully and we can also see that the password is "mickeymouse".
Since it is not in the flag format ( "picoCTF{XXXXXX}" ),I transformed it into flag format( "picoCTF{mickeymouse}" ) just like it said in the description part.
And there we go the flag is correct!

Happy Hacking!
